# COMMAND-LINE-TEST

The command line test is a program based on the BASH shell that simulates an online testing situation that requires logging in. The user will initially be presented with a sign-in choice, and only pre-defined users will be permitted to log in to the system. After a user has successfully logged in, this tool will present questions drawn from an existing database to that user. Additionally, it will handle error scenarios such as running out of time. This program will also save the answers that users offer so that they can be checked at a later time.
